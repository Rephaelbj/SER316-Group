I once decided to take a trip to the airport.
Once I was there I decided I wanted to vist Munich.
However, I found it too hot, so I took a train to Berlin.
While on the train the conductor had to check if we had our complementary Lederhose.
When I said no the conductor pulled out a machete and attempted to off me but was stopped when I threw a loaf of bread at him, a train conductorâ€™s only true weakness, which proceeded to make him explode.
It didn't stop there, suddenly robot soldiers burst in from the cart behind me; I grabbed my package of  greasy Bratwurst that came with my bread and threw it at the soldiers; as they stumbled in an attempt to get their bearings, I rushed outside to the front of my train car and locked the door and made my way up to the roof of the next car to make my escape.
luckly while on the roof of the train car i noticed an BMW was flooring it to keep up to where i was, i jumped from the train aiming at the roof of the car but i must have defied physics because i was sent flying through the air towards the nearest highrise.
