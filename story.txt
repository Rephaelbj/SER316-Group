I once decided to take a trip to the airport.
Once I was there I decided I wanted to vist Munich.
However, I found it too hot, so I took a train to Berlin.
While on the train the conductor had to check if we had our complementary Lederhose.
When I said no the conductor pulled out a machete and attempted to off me but was stopped when I threw a loaf of bread at him, a train conductorâ€™s only true weakness, which proceeded to make him explode.
